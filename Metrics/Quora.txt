tldr; 
The word you’re looking for is “dysergy” or “disergy.” In the medical field, ‘dysergia’ is the lack of muscular coordination due to defective nerve conduction.  It has been known to be the opposite of ‘synergy’ in some colloquialisms.

Although not widely accepted as the opposite of ‘synergy’ because there isn’t enough usage (counter-proof: if enough people say a word, it’s legit: e.g. Homer Simpson’s ‘doh’), its root is appropriate and even tends to agree with similar words in common vernacular.

Syn (meaning ‘together’) in the use case of synergy is similar to synthesis or synchronize, with the subtext of making or effervescing something from nothing [synthesis - make something from an idea; synchronize - make a reference to align with time].  The total work of the group produces better results than the individual efforts summed together.

Dys (meaning ‘negative, bad, imperfect, lessening’)  in this use case is similar to disease or dystopian, where the opposite is not the antithesis of synergy, but the existence of a total sum less than its components.  All the parts are basically working fine, but poor communication and eroded channels create a product which is less than the summation of work of the individual parts. Many movement disorders result in muscle loss, but early symptoms occur with normal muscle tissue receiving improper signals.  This could be considered a ‘disergistic’ effect as there is less control despite having the muscular requirements.  Fun example: The social game of ‘telephone’

Just an opinion.
