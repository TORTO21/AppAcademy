JavaScript

- Dynamic
  - can execute many common behaviors at run time as opposed to having to be compiled
- Weakly Typed
  - It's types are not very strong; it will easily allow you to coerce one type to another (i.e. 1 + '1' will return '11')
  - It will try to turn one type into another
- Protoype Based
  - That is its method of inheritance.  Basically everything will inheirt from an object prototype as opposed to a class which is more like a blue print which tells the compiler how it should make an instance of a class
- Multi-Paradigmed
  -
