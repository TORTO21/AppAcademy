Numbers Game
  - Even with a perfect resume, you'll need to send out 100s of applications

Structure for resume:
1. Projects
2. Skills
  - Resumes are fed through A.I. that filter resumes by key words.  Have them.
3. Experience
  - Most important section, but usually not related
  - Having full Stack Experience
  - Even having an internship for free with production level code
4. Education
  - Can move up if already have a degree in Computer Science


Tips:
  - Put your skills in the order you want them to be noticed.
  - Start at the top, start at the left
  - Put JavaScript, React more toward the left if front end
  - Show your location so they know where you are.  Let the recruiters know if you're local
    - Generally recruits don't want to relocate a candidate
  - Use Action verbs
  - Make sure your links for Live, GitHub, and personal site work.
    - Manu students are rejected the moment they had a dead link

  - Font Size of 9 is TOO SMALL.  Make sure everyone can read it
  - Hirers are looking for reasons to disqualify resumes

"Not Enough Experience"
  - One of the most common reasons for rejection is "not enough experience"
  - Sometimes it's not true, but really a generic rejection reason
  - Try doing 10 hours/week at an internship doing real development code
  - Reverse engineer your dream job and get that experience
